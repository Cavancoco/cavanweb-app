 * The 'panzoom' interaction allows to react to gestures in D3 components and interpret
 * them as pan and zoom actions.
 * One can then listen to the 'panzoom' event of the interaction or implement the
 * Ext.d3.Component#onPanZoom method and receive the translation and scaling
 * components that can be applied to the content.
 * The way in which pan/zoom gestures are interpreted is highly configurable,
 * and it's also possible to show a scroll indicator.
